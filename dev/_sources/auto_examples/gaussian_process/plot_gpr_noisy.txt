=============================================================
Gaussian process regression (GPR) with noise-level estimation
=============================================================

This example illustrates that GPR with a sum-kernel including a WhiteKernel can
estimate the noise level of data. An illustration of the
log-marginal-likelihood (LML) landscape shows that there exist two local
maxima of LML. The first corresponds to a model with a high noise level and a
large length scale, which explains all variations in the data by noise. The
second one has a smaller noise level and shorter length scale, which explains
most of the variation by the noise-free functional relationship. The second
model has a higher likelihood; however, depending on the initial value for the
hyperparameters, the gradient-based optimization might also converge to the
high-noise solution. It is thus important to repeat the optimization several
times for different initializations.
