==================
Prediction Latency
==================

This is an example showing the prediction latency of various scikit-learn
estimators.

The goal is to measure the latency one can expect when doing predictions
either in bulk or atomic (i.e. one by one) mode.

The plots represent the distribution of the prediction latency as a boxplot.
