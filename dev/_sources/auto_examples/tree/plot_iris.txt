Plot the decision surface of a decision tree on the iris dataset
================================================================

Plot the decision surface of a decision tree trained on pairs
of features of the iris dataset.

See :ref:`decision tree <tree>` for more information on the estimator.

For each pair of iris features, the decision tree learns decision
boundaries made of combinations of simple thresholding rules inferred from
the training samples.
