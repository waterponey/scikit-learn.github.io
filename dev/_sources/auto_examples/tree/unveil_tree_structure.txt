=========================================
Understanding the decision tree structure
=========================================

The decision tree structure can be analysed to gain further insight on the
relation between the features and the target to predict. In this example, we
show how to retrieve:

- the binary tree structure;
- the depth of each node and whether or not it's a leaf;
- the nodes that were reached by a sample using the ``decision_path`` method;
- the leaf that was reached by a sample using the apply method;
- the rules that were used to predict a sample;
- the decision path shared by a group of samples.
